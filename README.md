Cottontail DB is a column store aimed at multimedia retrieval. It allows for classical boolean as well as vector-space retrieval, i.e., nearest-neighbours lookup, as used in similarity search. If you're interested in using or contributing to
Cottontail DB, please have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb/wiki/).

## Setup
Cottontail DB requires Java 11 or newer (Open JDK or Oracle JDK should both work). Please clone this repository using:

``git clone https://github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb.git``

The entire project is a Gradle project and comes with a Gradle Wrapper so things should work pretty much out of the box.

### Building and starting Cottontail DB

A distribution of Cottontail DB can be built from the sources using the Gradle tasks `distTar` or `distZip`. This distribution includes the actual DBMS as well as the CLI. Distributions are
stored relatively to the project root in `build/distributions` as either TAR or ZIP file.

You can also build an executable JAR of the DBMS and the CLI with the `cottontaildb-dbms:shadowJar` or `cottontaildb-cli:shadowJar` gradle tasks respectively. Those JARs are stored relative to the respective module.

All the details as to how Cottontail DB can be setup and started can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb/wiki/Setup).

### Using Cottontail DB Docker Image

Cottontail DB is available as Docker Image from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vitrivr/cottontaildb). Please have a look at the repository instructions and/or the [Wiki](https://github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb/wiki/Setup) for more information.

### Connecting to Cottontail DB

Communication with Cottontail DB is facilitated by [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). By default, the gRPC endpoint runs on **port 1865**. To connect to Cottontail DB, you must first generate the model classes and stubs using the gRPC library of your
preference based on the programming environment you use. You can find the latest gRPC definitions [here](https://github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb-proto).

For Kotlin and Java, there is also a Maven dependency, which includes pre-built stubs and models as well as a client API:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.vitrivr</groupId>
  <artifactId>cottontaildb-client</artifactId>
  <version>0.16.0</version>
</dependency>
```

More information as to how to connect to and use Cottontail DB can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb/wiki/Connecting-to-Cottontail-DB) and the [example repository](https://github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb-examples).

### CLI / ðŸ¥•-LI
Cottontail DB comes with a CLI application called ðŸ¥•-LI. The CLI is bundled with the distribution but can also be built separately using the `cottontaildb-cli:shadowJar` gradle task.

### Compatibility with vitrivr

Please refer to the [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb/wiki/Compatibility-Matrix) to check for compatibility with other *vitrivr* components.
